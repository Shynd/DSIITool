# DSIITool

# Info
At the moment this program only supports simple byte-array patches (such as nop-ing out bytes responsible for decreasing stamina), it is however going to get expanded into codecave injection in order to support more extensive mods.

# WARNING
This program is still in the early development stages! Do not run DSIITool without backing up your savefiles unless you want to get softbanned. Furthermore you should only use DSIITool while playing offline.
