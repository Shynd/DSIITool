# DSIITool

## IMPORTANT
This tool only officially supports the v1.0.2.0 Steam version of the game. Pirated and/or older versions of the game are _not_ supported, and they never will be.

## Implemented features
* Unlimited estus
* Unlimited stamina

## Coming features
* Unlimited health - This is still not done, the research on how to do it is complete, I just haven't had time to implement it yet (read more in Program.cs).
* A way to toggle what cheats you want to enable, right now everything is enabled by default.

## Info
At the moment this program only supports simple byte-array patches (such as nop-ing out bytes responsible for decreasing stamina), it is however going to get expanded into codecave injection in order to support more extensive mods.

### WARNING
This program is still in the early development stages! Do _NOT_ run DSIITool without backing up your savefiles unless you want to get softbanned. Furthermore, you should only use DSIITool while playing offline.
